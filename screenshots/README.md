# Screenshots - PCP Results Organizer

**For developers who love Plugin Check but hate unwieldy results** ðŸŽ¯

## What's in here

These screenshots show the before/after of what this plugin does to the WordPress Plugin Check tool. Because let's be honest - PCP gives us amazing data, but sometimes you just want to focus on specific issues without scrolling through everything.

### Screenshot-1.jpg
**The "Before" - Standard PCP Interface**
- What you normally see in Tools â†’ Plugin Check
- Useful, but can be overwhelming for large plugins
- No filtering, no organization, just raw results

### Screenshot-2.jpg
**Plugin Selection in Action**
- The dropdown that lets you pick which plugin to analyze
- Works with any plugin you have installed
- Clean integration with existing PCP workflow

### Screenshot-3.jpg
**The Magic - Full Organizer Interface** âœ¨
- This is where the magic happens
- Right-side organizer panel with real-time stats
- Filter by file, error type, or specific error codes
- Export options (CSV, JSON, TXT) for when you want AI to fix everything
- eePCP link (because why not give credit where it's due)

### Screenshot-4.jpg
**Filtered Results - Clean & Focused**
- After applying filters - much more manageable
- Focus on what actually matters to you
- No more hunting through massive lists

## The Story Behind These

This plugin was born from frustration with command-line tools and a love for the new Plugin Check tool. It's mostly "vibe-coded" with Claude because honestly, complex JavaScript isn't my strong suit, but the basics make sense.

**The best part?** It just works with PCP's existing DOM. No database changes, no complex integrations - just enhanced UI that makes the existing tool better.

## For the Community

If you're thinking "I could make this better" - **PLEASE DO!**

This is meant to be a starting point. Take it, fork it, improve it. The WordPress community deserves tools that don't require a computer science degree to use effectively.
